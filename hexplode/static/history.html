<p>The game of Hexplode originally appeared in 1982 in PCW (Personal Computer 
World) magazine as a BASIC program for the BBC Micro written by J. Ansell.
</p><p>
The original game was played on a board of 25 hexagonal tiles and only enabled 
to play between two human players. The game was later ported to many other
platforms where it was often extended to support bigger boards and more players.

The video above is of the the original game running on the BeebEm BBC emulator.
